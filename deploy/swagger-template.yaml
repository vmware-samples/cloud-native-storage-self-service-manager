        1. `TotalOrphans` - The total number of orphan volumes found.
        
        2. `OrphanVolumes` - The list of orphan volumes found.
        
        3. `RetryAfterMinutes` - The time in minutes after which the next retry should be attempted to get the updated orphan volume list.

        6. `Limit` - The maximum number of orphan volumes to be returned.
        
        7. `NextOffset` - The offset of the next page if there are more orphan volumes to query.
        
        Orphan volumes are safe to delete since there is no PersistentVolume in the Kubernetes cluster referring to them.

      summary: List all the orphan snapshots.
      description: |-
        Use this API to identify orphan snapshots. From vSphere CSI plugin's perspective,
        orphan snapshots are FCD snapshots that were initiated through the vSphere CSI driver
        but do not have a corresponding VolumeSnapshotContent object in the Kubernetes cluster.
        snapshotPrefix is the prefix used in the snapshot description. Its default value is “snapshot”,
        which is also the default value used by snapshot sidecar in CSI and it can be configured based
        on prefix used in the snapshot sidecar. Use the `snapshotPrefix` parameter to specify alternate
        prefix.

        From Velero vSphere plugin's perspective, orphan snapshots are snapshots whose upload is failing
        with multiple attempts or snapshots whose local deletion is failing after successful upload.
        For Velero vSphere plugin, user has to specify “AstrolabeSnapshot” as the snapshotPrefix.

        GET API for orphan snapshots support pagination. The response body contains totalOrphanSnapshots,
        limit and offset values. Also, response header contains X-Limit and X-Next-Offset values. Based on these
        values user can decide if there are more results to be fetched.
        Since the detection of orphan snapshots is an expensive operation, the operation is performed asynchronously
        at regular intervals. This API returns the list of orphan snapshots found in the last run of the operation.
        `retryAfterMinutes` in response body indicates the time in minutes after which the next retry should be
        attempted to get the updated orphan snapshot list.
